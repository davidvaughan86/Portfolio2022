                        Thanks for coming by! I'm David Vaughan (Von) and I have about 3 more seconds to wow you before you click somewhere else. So let me make this quick! I'm from California originally where I studied Networks. I moved to Atlanta and became a Full Stack Developer via bootcamp and then became a TA for the bootcamp.
                        <hr id="secret">
                         Others describe me as personable and friendly. I love f√∫tbol, fitness, food, and I have a pup! I have a passion for creating apps and baked goods. Ok, talk soon!

                            When I'm not coding I'm out getting my hands dirty. I love learning new things and I'm up for challenges. I work well under pressure. Expereinces are what memories are made of.
