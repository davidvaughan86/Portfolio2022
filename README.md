I decided to completely recreate my profile from scratch rather than using a template. I want to show my abilities to create pages for myself and for others.


Challenges
    1. Deciding on a background.
    2. Flexbox
    3. Animating CSS


Creating a portfolio really helped me test my HTML and CSS coding. I used google/W3/OS for the difficult animations but ultimately learned how to miniuplate objects as they move around the screen. I had a fun time getting colors and design to match. Ultimately I had a blast creating my protfolio. 

I created this over the course of 2 days. Two 12 hour coding sessions back to back. I recently watched a youtube motivational video about sitting still and CODING. So I did just that. 

I have several projects listed.
    1. Dinning with the ISS
    2. Coding Quiz app
    3. Sonny BNBs (coming Novemember 2022)
    4. Puppy Love (coming December 2022)
    5. Gym Buddy (coming December 2022)
    6. Schedule Wiz (January 2022
